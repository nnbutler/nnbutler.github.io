Mechanical engineering has been a lifelong passion that began in childhood, fueled by countless hours spent building with LEGOs and competing in LEGO robotics. This early fascination evolved into a love for innovation and problem-solving, leading me to build my own 3D printers and conduct cutting-edge research in large-scale additive manufacturing during college. Since then, I’ve had the privilege of developing custom robotics for multiple companies. My journey has deepened my focus on CAD and mechanical design, particularly where it intersects with automation. For me, mechanical engineering isn’t just a field of study or work—it’s a way to blend creativity with the tools to make my visions a reality.

My journey as a software developer began early, writing code for FIRST Lego League challenges and discovering the thrill of making creations move with purpose. In college, my skills in electrical systems and software began to stand out within my mechanical engineering teams, sparking a passion for the flexibility and power that software offers. I was driven by the desire to bring the robots I designed to life, enabling them to move and behave intelligently. Being part of the early wave of machine learning and computer vision adoption further fueled this passion, allowing me to work at the intersection of hardware and software. To me, software is the ultimate tool to unlock the full potential of a mechanical system. Writing the code that transforms a static machine into a living, functional entity is not just a skill—it's one of the most rewarding experiences I know.

My journey into software development started early, coding for FIRST Lego League challenges and discovering the thrill of bringing creations to life. In college, my skills in electrical systems and software set me apart within my mechanical engineering teams, sparking a passion for the versatility and power of programming. I was driven by the challenge of making robots move intelligently, integrating software to enhance their capabilities. Being part of the early wave of machine learning and computer vision adoption deepened this passion, allowing me to work at the intersection of hardware and software. To me, coding is more than a skill—it’s the key to unlocking a machine’s full potential, transforming static designs into dynamic, functional systems.

I have a deep passion for creating and building, a love that truly comes to life in my personal makerspace. My garage is a haven for innovation, equipped with three 3D printers, a laser cutter, a vinyl cutter, a full woodshop, and an array of hand/power tools. It’s my sanctuary for experimenting, prototyping, and bringing ideas to life. Beyond my makerspace, I take pride in the projects I’ve tackled with my wife—together, we’ve completely remodeled the house we purchased in 2019. From woodworking to custom designs, our hands-on approach has transformed it into a home that reflects our shared creativity and dedication.
