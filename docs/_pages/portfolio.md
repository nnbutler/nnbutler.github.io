Lead the team that took a proof of concept project to scalable product with over 20 installs. Leveraged containerization and NVIDIA Deepstream to create a solution capable of Over-The-Air updates, automatic configuration and a Azure based data pipeline for continuous model improvement. Optimized an Amazon Sagemaker workflow for distrubted image labeling and retraining. Oversaw product roadmap and helped prioritize new features while also contributing to full stack development for both edge and server side technologies.

## 5 Axis Autonomous Car Wash (2019-2022)

Led a team of 6 to design and bring a new car wash solution to market using half the water and chemicals of competitors by leveraging a custom 5-axis motion platform, dual LiDAR scanners, and a custom pump stand. The car wash was installed and tested in multiple locations, washing over 300 cars. This was the first car wash in the world to implement 3D scanning, predictive maintenance, and custom toolpathing for each vehicle.

## Thermoplastic Extruder for Large Format 3D Printing (2017-2018)

Started as a Senior Capstone at Oregon State University, this project was funded through a $25K Venturewell E-Team grant I wrote my junior year. Taking this project from concept through production required extensive use of CAD, FEA simulation, as well as a self-taught knowledge of polymer extrusion. The result was an industrial tool that offered best-in-class control and performance, all with less than half the manufacturing cost of the nearest competing product. This project was one of multiple undertaken while I was the CEO at Form Forge LLC.

## Waterless Concrete Printer for NASA Centennial Challenge (2017)

For Phase 2 of the NASA Mars 3D Printed Habitat Centennial Challenge, I led a team of four that developed a 3D printer able to print in a combination of HDPE (milk jug) plastic and silica sand. On a shoestring budget, our team secured second place and $70K in prize money. This would become the foundation on which I founded Form Forge LLC. The final beam was twice as strong as concrete and used 70% indigenous material to reduce the need to bring materials from Earth.

## World First Hybrid Desktop Manufacturing Tool (2014-2015)

<iframe width="280" height="157" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zyelnf7xC9Y?si=ehJ5QcGD9XJaIK6r" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

While working as an undergraduate, I developed the first desktop printer able to automatically switch between a 3D printing or “additive” head and a cutting or “subtractive” tool. This combination of technologies merged the ease of 3D printing with the precision of CNC machined parts. This project required an emphasis on design for manufacturing, focusing on the use of off-the-shelf parts and open-source hardware to deliver a product from a garage workbench.

## Micro Textures for Composite Adhesion (2014)

While working with Autodesk and Lightning Motorcycles to develop strategies for additive manufacturing composite core structures, I developed a method for creating a mechanical bond between the incompatible resin chemistries of the UV-cure resins used by polyjet 3D printers and the thermoset resins traditionally used in composites. The results were featured in Forbes Magazine.
